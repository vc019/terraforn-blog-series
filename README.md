I have removed ssh keys from the code. Please make sure you add your own ssh keys to the code. 
To add the ssh keys. Please do the following steps
1. Create folder - **ssh-keys** in any of the blog sub folders.
2. Please create ssh keys with the name using **ssh-keygen** utility    
   - myblog-key  
   - myblog-key.pub  
3. If you are not sure how to create ssh keys please look at this url which has pretty good instructions.
